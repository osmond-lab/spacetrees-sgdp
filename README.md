# Inferring the spatial history of humans with ancestral recombination graphs and comparing methods

This code was used to create an informal paper: https://osmond-lab.github.io/spacetrees-sgdp.html.

Snakefile (with the help of spacetrees.py and utils.py) was used to create the data/ from tree sequences kindly provided by Leo Speidel (see https://academic.oup.com/mbe/article/38/9/3497/6299394). plots.ipynb was used to create the plots/ from the data/.

See https://github.com/osmond-lab/spacetrees for more information on our spatial inference method.
